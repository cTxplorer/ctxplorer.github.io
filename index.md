# Welcome

We learn new things everyday. However to retain our learning, we need to review what we learnt at some point of time. This is my way of keeping track of my learnings from things I do on daily basis.

[Rachel Thomas's post](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045) inspired me to setup this awesome site with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

-  Connectors are vital part of the society who have special gift of bringing the world together
-  They are few individuals with knack for making friends and acquaintances whom all of us can reach in only few steps
-  Thought: Like Roger Horchow, I should have a _roster of people I know_ with their names and circumstances under which I met them.

#### Project: Solved JSON parsing issue in JS
-  Issue: Assumed that for loop traversal in JS to return element
-  Actually JS returns index of the element
