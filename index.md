## Welcome

We learn new things everyday. However to retain our learning, we need to revisit what we learnt at some point of time. This is my way of keeping track of my learning from things I doing on daily basis.

[Rachel Thomas's post](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045) inspired me to setup this awesome site with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
